      By default, transitive dependency versions are determined by resolving the package metadata defined by the
      graph.  To override the version of a transitive dependency, you would normally need to add that package as
      a top-level dependency.  The CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled property tells NuGet that if any
      PackageVersion is defined in Directory.Packages.props that matches any transitive dependency to use that
      version instead and elevate it to a top-level dependency.
